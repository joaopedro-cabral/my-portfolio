This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This project marked my inaugural foray into modern/advanced web development, serving as both a learning experience and an opportunity to refine my knowledge by developing a personal portfolio project using [TypeScript], [ReactJS], [TailwindCSS], and the [Next.js] framework.

To kickstart the project, I employed [Figma] to create an initial visual concept for the website. This allowed me to envision the design and layout before diving into the coding phase.

## Technologies
